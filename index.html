			<p class="intro">Web development has changed a lot recently, focusing more on making websites work well on
				phones. This switch is because many people now use smartphones and tablets to go online. So, web
				developers are working to make sure websites look good and work smoothly on these devices. The number of
				people using the internet on mobile devices is over 60%, according to a 2023 survey by W3Techs. This
				means that having a website that works well on mobiles is super important to keep people interested.</p>

			<p> This move towards mobile-friendly websites is not just a trend; it's necessary. People use their phones
				a lot, and if a website doesn't work well on them, users might just leave. So, it's important for
				developers to think about mobiles when creating websites to stay competitive.</p>

			<p class="heading-400">some ways to make websites responsive</p>
			<p class="methods">To make a website that works on both big computer screens and small phone screens,
				developers use different tricks. They can use ready-made tools like Bootstrap or Foundation, which help
				in making websites that look good on any device. Another trick is using flexible grids and images that
				can change size based on the device. Also, using CSS with <code>@media-query {}</code> helps apply
				specific styles depending on whether the user is on a computer or a phone.</p>

			<p class="heading-400">example:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-css">@media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {
  /* â€¦ */
}			</code></pre>
