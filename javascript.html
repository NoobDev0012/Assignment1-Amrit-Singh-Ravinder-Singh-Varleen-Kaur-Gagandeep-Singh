			<p class="body">JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for building interactive and
				dynamic websites. Its purpose is to enhance the functionality of web pages by providing a means to
				manipulate the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>, allowing developers to dynamically update
				and modify the content and style of web pages without requiring a page reload. Over time, JavaScript has
				evolved into a powerful language that is not only essential for front-end web development but also
				widely used on the server-side (Node.js) and for mobile app development.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				It is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language and not compiled. JavaScript is relatively compact, yet
				very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language,
				unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
			</p>

			<ul class="body list">
				<li><strong>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) </strong> built into web browsers,
					providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and
					manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
				<li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
					providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
				<li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building
					sites and applications.</li>
			</ul>

			<span id="coreLang" class="heading-700">KYL - Know Your Language (Variables and Data Types in
				JavaScript)</span>

			<p class="body">In order to know more about the language it's great to take a look at the core features of
				the language.
			</p>

			<p id="variables" class="heading-400">Variables</p>

			<p class="body">These are the containers in which the users can store different types of data. We can create
				one by using the <code>let</code> keyword.</p>

			<pre><code>let newVariable;</code></pre>

			<p class="body">Notice the <code>;</code>? It is there to specify that a line has ended.</p>

			<p class="body">Javascript is case-sensitive. That means <code>newvariable</code> is not same as
				<code>newVariable</code>. <br> Once a variable is declared you can assign some value to it.
			</p>

			<pre><code>newVariable = "javascript";</code></pre>

			<p class="body">Variables can also be declared by <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

			<pre><code>var TimeOftheDay = 'morning';
let orange = 10;</code></pre>

			<p class="body">There are many types of data that we can store in variables. Some of the basic data types
				are:</p>

			<pre><code>let greeting = "Hello"; 	// string 
let age = 25;			// integer
let isAdult = true;		// boolean
let person = null;		// null
let job; 			// undefined</code></pre>

			<p id="operators" class="heading-400">operators</p>
			<p class="body">Operators are the symbols that represent particular operations on different values and
				variables. These operators make the language capable of performing certain actions such as arithmetic
				calculations, assignment, comparison, and logical operations. </p>

			<pre><code>5 + 8;		//Addition
10 - 3;		//Subtraction
10 * 3;		//Multiplication
100 / 10; 	//Division 
let num = 10;	//Assignment
num === 5; 	//Strict equality
!(true); 	//NOT
num !== "red";  //not-equal </code></pre>

			<p class="body">These operators helps in evaluating and checking different conditions when they are paired
				with <code>conditional blocks</code></p>

			<p id="conditionalStmt" class="heading-400">Conditional Statements</p>
			<p class="body">Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code. These code structures are
				used to check whether a statement is true or false. The code then behave accordingly.</p>

			<pre><code>let age = 18;

// if-else statement
if (age >= 18) {
console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
console.log("You are a minor.");
}</code></pre>

			<p class="body">Here the code checks the <code>if()</code> condition and compares <code>age</code> variable
				with provided integer. If the result is true the first code block runs else the second code block is
				executed. One can add multiple checks by chaining the <code>if...else</code> conditional.</p>

			<p id="func" class="heading-400">Functions</p>
			<p class="body">Functions can be defined as reusable code blocks. It's possible to define a body of code as
				a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. Javascript allow us to store a
				set of commands/operations in a function so that we don't have to rewrite the code everytime.</p>

			<pre><code>// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
	console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Function invocation
greet("Alice");
</code></pre>

			<p class="body">In the above code the keyword <code>function</code> is used to declare a function named
				<code>greet()</code> which requires a name. This is likely to be a <code>string</code> data type. The
				code inside the <code>{}</code> is what is executed when a function is called.
			</p>

			<p class="body">At the time of calling a function to run. we write the name of the declared function
				(case-sensitive) followed by the data required in <code>()</code>. This will invoke the function and run
				the code in it.</p>

			<p class="body">In this example notice <code>console.log()</code>? It is also an in-built function which
				takes in a data type and logs it to the web-browser's console. This is mostly used for debugging the
				code.</p>

			<pre><code>let greet = function() { console.log("hello") };

greet();</code></pre>

			<p class="body">We can also assign annonymous functions to a variable and call them as we would normally do.
			</p>

			<p id="obj" class="heading-400">objects</p>
			<p class="body">Objects are collections of data types. These consist of key-value pairs in
				<code>key:value</code> order. Where key is a string (or symbol) and value can be any data type including
				other objects.
			</p>

			<pre><code>let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdult: true,
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};</code></pre>

			<p class="body">It can be observed that the object <code>person</code> has multiple properties such as name
				and age. It also contains a <code>sayHello</code> function that can be called as a method of this
				object.</p>

			<pre><code>person.name; 	//OUTPUT: 'John'
person.name = 'Stan';	//updating object property
person['age'] 	//OUTPUT: 30
</code></pre>

			<p class="body">The object's properties can be accessed and used by the above shown methods. It is also
				possible to update the properties of the object by using assignment operator <code>=</code>. </p>

			<pre><code>person.sayHello()</code></pre>

			<p class="body">With objects we can invoke their methods by using the above syntax. Where the
				<code>person</code> is the variable name assigned to the object, <code>sayHello()</code> is the method
				declared in the object. These are joined by a dot(.)
			</p>

			<p id="arrays" class="heading-400">Arrays</p>
			<p class="body">Arrays are type of objects. Instead of using key-value pair, array uses numerical index
				numbers to access it's elements. It can be considered as a list.</p>

			<pre><code>let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];</code></pre>

			<p class="body">The above syntax is used to declare an array. Here the data (strings) is enclosed in
				<code>[]</code> and separated by <code>,</code>.
			</p>

			<pre><code>fruit[0]; 	//OUTPUT: "apple" 
fruit[1]; 	//OUTPUT: "orange"</code></pre>


			<p class="body">In order to access the elements of an array, integers starting from 0 are used. Where 0
				depicts the first element in the array.</p>

			<p class="body">Similar to object. Array's elements can also be updated using the following syntax :</p>

			<pre><code>fruit[0] = "mango" 	// now fruit = ["mango","banana","orange"] </code></pre>


			<p id="loops" class="heading-400">Loops</p>
			<p class="body">In JavaScript, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are several types
				of loops, each serving different purposes. Here are three commonly used loop structures:</p>

			<p class="heading-400">For Loop</p>
			<p class="body">This loop is usually used when you know the number of iterations beforehand. It consists of
				an initialization statement, a condition, and an iteration statement.</p>

			<pre><code>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}</code></pre>

			<p class="body">In this example, the loop initializes <code>i</code> at 0, this initalised variable acts as
				a counter. This variable can be declared in the loop declaration or outside the loop. The loop executes
				the block of code as long as <code>i</code> is less than 5, and increments <code>i</code> by 1 after
				each iteration.</p>

			<p class="heading-400">While Loop</p>
			<p class="body">The <code>while</code> loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
				It repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>

			<pre><code>let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}</code></pre>

			<p class="body">This example achieves the same result as the <code>for</code> loop but uses a
				<code>while</code> loop. The block of code is executed as long as the condition <code>i < 5</code> is
				true.
			</p>

			<p class="heading-400">For...Of Loop</p>
			<p class="body">This specific loop is used for iterating over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, or
				other iterable structures.</p>

			<pre><code>let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}</code></pre>

			<p class="body">This loop goes over each element in the <code>fruits</code> array in sequence. One element
				of the array is accessed and then stored in the variable <code>fruit</code> declared in the loop
				initialisation, then after the loop runs the code it moves to the next element in the sequence.</p>

			<span id="domEdit" class="heading-700">Messing with HTML (DOM Manipulation)</span>

			<p class="heading-400">element selection</p>
			<p class="body">In order to create dynamic content in a webpage, the elements of the HTML has to be
				accessed. DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
				structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document,
				such as elements, attributes, and text content. </p>

			<p class="body">The DOM is used when we access the <code>document</code> object in Javascript. This is the
				top level object that holds all the elements and their properties.</p>

			<p class="body">If we have to change the text inside an HTML <code>&ltp&gt</code> tag, we will have to make
				an instance of the tag in Javascript so that we can access it's properties.</p>

			<pre><code>let textTag = document.querySelector("p");</code></pre>

			<p class="body">we have successfully created an instance of the paragraph tag in Javascript and now we can
				use the object's property like <code>innerHTML</code>to change the text in it.</p>

			<pre><code>textTag.innerHTML = "this is updated !"; </code></pre>

			<p class="body">There are many other ways in which we can access different elements of HTML file like: </p>

			<ul class="body list">
				<li>
					<code>getElementsByTagName</code>:
					<p>As the name suggest, this DOM selector gets all the elements that matches the given tag.
						<code>document.getElementsByTagName("div");</code>
						returns a list that contains all the <code>div</code>.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<code>getElementsByClassName</code>:
					<p>This gets all the elements with same class as passed as an argument to the method.
						<code>document.getElementsByClassName('heading')</code>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<code>getElementById</code>:
					<p>In this, the elements are selected based on the Ids. This may look similar to the tagname and
						Class name but this sector only returns the first matched element while ignoring the remaining.
						<code>document.getElementById('item')</code>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<code>querySelectorAll()</code>:
					<p>This method returns all the elements that matches the specified CSS selector in the document.
						<code>document.querySelectorAll('ul>li::after')</code>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
